CentOS 6 Oracle setup: 

Environment:
<pre>
ORACLE_BASE=/opt/oracle
ORACLE_HOME=/opt/oracle/product/11.2.0/dbhome_1
</pre>

This makes life much easier:
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/servers-storage-admin/ginnydbinstallonlinux-488779.html">Oracle 11g2 preinstall rpm</a>

Getting an error about display not > 256 colors?

Open terminal, and as the logged-in user type 
<pre>
xhost + ip-t3400-1542.ironplanet.local
</pre>

to allow usage of X applications

refer to <a href="http://www.unix.com/red-hat/116444-error-cant-open-display-0-0-a.html">http://www.unix.com/red-hat/116444-error-cant-open-display-0-0-a.html</a>

Then su oracle and run the installer


To avoid the issues with the db not being found due to oc4j Configuration issue/EM Configuration issue, install the db for "Server", not "Desktop"

Also change /etc/hosts and add as the first line:
<pre>
127.0.0.1 ip-t3400-1542.ironplanet.local
</pre>

  Maybe bug 8638267

  From the 11gR2 README file (under Open Bugs):
  /*

  Bug 8638267
  If you select the "Desktop Class" style database configuration in the Installer, and after completing the installation you attempt to create a database using DBCA or any DBControl setup using Enterprise Manager Configuration Assistant (EMCA), then you must set the ORACLE_HOSTNAME environment variable to 'localhost'. If you do not set ORACLE_HOSTNAME, then DBCA fails while configuring Enterprise Manager with the following error:
  Listener is not up or database service is not registered with it. Start the Listener and register database service and run EM Configuration Assistant again.

  Workaround: Set the ORACLE_HOSTNAME environment variable to 'localhost' and retry creating the database.

  <h1>Reading List</h1>

  I just saw a website where someone listed all the books they read in a year. What a great idea!

  <h2>2016</h2>
  Started:
  <ul>
    <li>The Algorithm Design Manual</li>
    <li>Introduction to Graph Theory</li>
    <li>Essential Java</li>
    <li>The Effective Engineer - almost done with Part 1 (2016-03-27)</li>
  </ul>

  Finished:
  <ul>
    <li>What to Do When It's Your Turn (Seth Godin)</li>
  </ul>
</body>
</html>

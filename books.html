<h1>Reading List</h1>

I just saw a website where someone listed all the books they read in a year. What a great idea!

<h3>2016</h3>
Started:
<ul>
<li>The Algorithm Design Manual</li>
<li>Introduction to Graph Theory</li>
<li>Essential Java</li>
</ul>
... and a bunch more

<br>

Finished:
<ul>
<li>What to Do When It's Your Turn (Seth Godin)</li>
</ul>

h2. 2016 February 17
This month I learned:

- How to tune postgres (yay pgtune)
- How to use sqlalchemy
- That interviewing is hard, but it can be fun too.
- A little bit about "https://github.com/carise/asst1_rasterizester":rasterizing lines. 
- That I'm not "senior enough" as an engineer... which was helpful in showing me how I need to grow.
- How to make real southern gumbo.

This month I learned:

- How to tune postgres (yay pgtune)
- How to use sqlalchemy
- That interviewing is hard, but it can be fun too.
- A little bit about "rasterizing lines":https://github.com/carise/asst1_rasterizester 
- That I'm not "senior enough" as an engineer... which was helpful in showing me how I need to grow.
- How to make real southern gumbo.

Spoke with an engineer at Planet Labs (phone interview) and he gave me a design question, "How would you design something like MixPanel so that you don't lose writes?" I've never worked on a production system with that kind of volume of data, but it was interesting to learn how you could use logs to recover data in case of an outage. Definitely have a lot more to learn...

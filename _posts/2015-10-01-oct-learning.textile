I drove manual in Friday afternoon traffic from Oakland back home! O_O

Also learning how to fly a drone. K bought it for me, hooray!!!!! :D

I think what I might do with this blog is use it to summarize what I've learned, and then link to it on my actual blog.

Lately, I've had the opportunity to play around with a raspberry pi. I'm looking forward to doing projects with it.

"f/stops":http://www.uscoles.com/fstop.htm
The "f/stop" is the ratio of the focal length to diameter. Each f/stop "down" halves the amount of light going through. So, f/8->f/11 is halving the amount of light. f/11->f/8 is doubling the amount of light. Small f/stop number, more light. Large f/stop number, less light.

CGI scripts should define a Content-Type header. A perl cgi script I was using was returning "Premature end of script headers". Looks like a proper CGI script should be returning some kind of Content-Type header.

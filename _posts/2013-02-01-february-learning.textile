"f/stops":http://www.uscoles.com/fstop.htm
The "f/stop" is the ratio of the focal length to diameter. Each f/stop "down" halves the amount of light going through. So, f/8->f/11 is halving the amount of light. f/11->f/8 is doubling the amount of light. Small f/stop number, more light. Large f/stop number, less light.

Using find with regexes, e.g.

@find . -regex ".*\.jsp.?" -regextype posix-extended@

Abstract class vs. interfaces
 - abstract class and implementing class strong relationship, e.g. "Dog" is-a "Animal"
 - abstract class is good for inheritance (e.g. adding new methods doesn't require all implementing classes to implement the new methods)
 - interface is good for when class won't change often
 - want something like multiple inheritance, then use an interface

Determining a type of object in javascript (ECMAScript standard):

@Object.prototype.toString.call(theobject);@

"Design everything you do" -- Stella Lai ("Making the Transition from Development to Design", P.J. Onori)


Vim:
1) Use @{@ and @}@ to move between paragraphs; use @{d}@ to delete it
2) Use "@m@"(marker name) to set marker boundaries, then @[command]`[marker name]@ to cut/copy that text. E.g. do @ma@ and @mz@, then @y`a@ to copy. I can also do this with @d`a@ to cut.

"@volatile@ in Java":http://jeremymanson.blogspot.fr/2008/11/what-volatile-means-in-java.html 

The @volatile@ modifier will ensure communication between two threads, so that if one thread writes to a volatile variable, the second thread that reads it already knows whatâ€™s going on with that particular volatile variable.
